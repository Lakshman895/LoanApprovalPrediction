## 📌 Project Overview
The **Loan Approval Prediction** project aims to build a model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various applicant details. This can help financial institutions streamline their loan approval process and reduce risks.

## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset contains various attributes of loan applicants, such as:
- **Loan_ID**: Unique identifier for the loan application.
- **Gender**: Applicant's gender (Male/Female).
- **Married**: Marital status (Yes/No).
- **Dependents**: Number of dependents.
- **Education**: Applicant's education level (Graduate/Not Graduate).
- **Self_Employed**: Whether the applicant is self-employed (Yes/No).
- **ApplicantIncome**: Applicant's income.
- **CoapplicantIncome**: Co-applicant's income.
- **LoanAmount**: Loan amount requested.
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Term of the loan in months.
- **Credit_History**: Whether the applicant has a good credit history (1: Yes, 0: No).
- **Property_Area**: The area type (Urban, Semiurban, Rural).
- **Loan_Status**: Approval status of the loan (Y: Approved, N: Not Approved).

## 🚀 Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies loan applications as **approved (Y) or not approved (N)** based on historical data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

## 📈 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding feature distributions and relationships.
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Training various models and selecting the best-performing one.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model performance.
5. **Predictions & Insights**: Deploying the model and making predictions.

## 🔥 Key Features
✅ Predict loan approval status with high accuracy.  
✅ Handle missing data and outliers effectively.  
✅ Feature engineering for better model performance.  
✅ Visual insights with EDA and feature importance.
